## Description
The aim of this project was tomodify the starter code to make Horiseon's website more accessible to ensure that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. 

By completing this project I learnt about semantic HTML, updating the CSS with comments to make the code more easily readble by web developers and ordering HTML and CSS code into sequential order. I also learnt that renaming images correctly, changing title elements and semantic HTML elements are all crucial for the readbility to people using the website.


## Website preview

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](Assets/01-html-css-git-challenge-demo.png)

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.
