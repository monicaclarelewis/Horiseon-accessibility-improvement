## Description
The aim of this project was tomodify the starter code to make Horiseon's website more accessible to ensure that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. 

By completing this project I learnt about semantic HTML, updating the CSS with comments to make the code more easily readble by web developers and ordering HTML and CSS code into sequential order. I also learnt that renaming images correctly, changing title elements and semantic HTML elements are all crucial for the readbility to people using the website.
