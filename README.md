## Description
The aim of this project was to modify the starter code to make Horiseon's website more accessible. This ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. 

By completing this project I learnt about semantic HTML, updating the CSS with comments to make the code more easily readble by web developers and ordering HTML and CSS code into sequential order. I also learnt that renaming images correctly, changing title elements and semantic HTML elements are all crucial for the website readbility.
